## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r malaria}
deaths <- data.table(deaths)
age<- data.table(age)
incidence <- data.table(incidence)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r malaria, echo=FALSE}

boxplot(deaths$`Deaths - Malaria - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized (Rate) (per 100,000 people)`~deaths$Entity)

ggplot(data = age, mapping = aes(x = year, y = deaths, fill = age_group)) + geom_smooth(method = "loess") + labs(x = "Year", y = "Deaths") + theme_bw()

p3 <- ggplot(data = incidence, mapping = aes(x = Entity, y = `Incidence of malaria (per 1,000 population at risk) (per 1,000 population at risk)`, fill = Year)) + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = Year), shape = 21) + coord_flip() + theme_bw() + labs(x = NULL,  y = "Incidence", fill = "Year")
ggplotly(p2)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
